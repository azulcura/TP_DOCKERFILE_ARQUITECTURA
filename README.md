# TP_DOCKERFILE_ARQUITECTURA

In this work, integrated by the students of Commission 3 of Architecture and Operating Systems, we create a dockerfile that uses ubuntu 20.04.

The dockerfile has curl, telnet and apache installed in its latest version.

In addition, the dockerfile has an index html file copied to a specific directory of the container with its corresponding ports.

And lastly, the dockerfile has the default apache command defined to start the container
